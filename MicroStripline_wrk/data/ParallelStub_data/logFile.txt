Warning detected by hpeesofsim in Substrate model during netlist flattening.
    Simulations referencing substrate `MSub1' will not include metal loss
    because metal thickness is zero.
Done with exporting 1 VerilogA device(s).
Warning detected by hpeesofsim in topology check during circuit set up.
    Number of nodes with only one device attached (topology corrected): 3

Pt DC convergence is used.
